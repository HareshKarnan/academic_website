I'm a third year PhD student working with Dr.Peter Stone at the Learning Agents Research Group at UT Austin. My research interests are in Robotics and AI and I'm particularly interested in Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Robot Localization. I'm currently focused on the intersection of transfer learning (Sim-to-Real), Imitation Learning and Visual Navigation for real world robots.
